# This is a super simple (but slow) example of running face recognition on live video from your webcam.
# There's a second example that's a little more complicated but runs faster.

# PLEASE NOTE: This example requires OpenCV (the `cv2` library) to be installed only to read from your webcam.
# OpenCV is *not* required to use the face_recognition library. It's only required if you want to run this
# specific demo. If you have trouble installing it, try any of the other demos that don't require it instead.

# Get a reference to webcam #0 (the default one)
video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Grab a single frame of video
ret, frame = video_capture.read()

# Find all facial features in all the faces in the image
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(frame)

print("I found {} face(s) in this photograph.".format(len(face_landmarks_list)))

# Create a PIL imagedraw object so we can draw on the picture
pil_image = Image.fromarray(frame)
d = ImageDraw.Draw(pil_image)

for face_landmarks in face_landmarks_list:
    # Print the location of each facial feature in this image
    for facial_feature in face_landmarks.keys():
        print("The {} in this face has the following points: {}".format(facial_feature, face_landmarks[facial_feature]))

    # Let's trace out each facial feature in the image with a line!
    for facial_feature in face_landmarks.keys():
        d.line(face_landmarks[facial_feature], width=1)

# Show the picture
